# Amazon.com.tr Login Functionalities Test Script
This is a Python script designed to test the login functionalities of Amazon.com.tr site. The script contains two functions, `test_login_with_correct_credentials` and `test_login_with_wrong_password`, which are used to test the login feature with correct and incorrect credentials. The script also includes a helper module `register` which can be used to create a new Amazon.com.tr account.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script you need to have the following prerequisites:

* Python 3.x installed on your system
* Selenium WebDriver for Python installed
* Chrome or Firefox browser installed on your system

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```pip install selenium```

## Usage
To run the script, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run the following command:

```python main.py```

This will run both the `test_login_with_correct_credentials` and `test_login_with_wrong_password` functions and display the test results in the console.

If you don't have an Amazon.com.tr account and want to create one, you can press `y`.
